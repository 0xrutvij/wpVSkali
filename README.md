# wpVSkali
Docker Implementation of a Vagrant/Vbox setup for CodePath

## Installing Docker

- For Mac OSX
  - Using the installer at this [link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) installs all the components necessary for this exercise.
  - Ensure python3 is installed if the usage of modifyCompose CLI app is desired.

- For Windows
  - The installer at this [link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) includes all the necessary components.
  - Ensure python3 is installed if the usage of modifyCompose CLI app is desired.

- For Linux Distros
  - Follow the distro specific instructions for the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
  - There is no GUI included for Linux, and if needed install [Portainer](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/deploy/ceinstalldocker/), an open source application which can help view and manage containers.
  - Ensure python3 is installed if the usage of modifyCompose CLI app is desired.

## Build
Build the image for Kali and make a folder to bind to the Wordpress container

---
**NOTE**

- Windows has build kit enabled by default on newer installs, in such cases the env var `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` can be skipped.
- Install the latest python3 to use the wordpress version change CLI App.

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xrutvij/wpVSkali.git
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build
mkdir wpFolder
```

## Run Wordpress(+mysql) and Kali containers

- ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ID=$(docker ps -a | grep kaliCP | gawk '{print $1}') && docker exec -it $ID bash
  ```
  On Windows the second command changes to

  ```text
  cmd.exe /c "for /F `"tokens=1`" %a in ('docker ps -a ^| findstr kaliCP') do docker exec -it %a bash"
  ```

- Second command opens a terminal with root privileges on Kali Linux and has the same network accessibility as the host machine.
- Both on the host machine and on the Kali terminal, the WordPress website is accessible at http://localhost:8080
- Note to self: xargs doesn't work with docker exec since it doesn't allocate a tty for the piped input, thus usage of a shell variable is necessary.

- Type `exit` to exit the Kali bash shell and to shutdown all running containers use,

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```

- This command removes all the containers and the network created. All named volumes are retained and they provide persistence.


- For changing WordPress versions, use the modifyCompose.py script, usage is as follows
  Install the requirements file for python3 before proceeding `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

  ```bash
  Modify Compose File.

  Usage:
    modifyCompose.py [--wordpress=<ver>] [--wpPort=<port>]
    modifyCompose.py (-h | --help)
    modifyCompose.py (-v | --version)
    modifyCompose.py (--listWpVer)

  Options:
    -h --help            Show this screen.
    -v --version         Show version.
    --wordpress=<ver>    Wordpress version to use [default: latest].
    --wpPort=<port>      Port at which the Wordpress website is served [default: 8080].
    --listWpVer          List Wordpress versions available.
  ```
  - To change the version use (replace 4.1.0 with the version needed) and follow the prompts.
    ```bash
    python3 modifyCompose.py --wordpress=4.1.0
    ```
  - To change the port at which WP is served use and follow the prompts.
    ```bash
    python3 modifyCompose.py --wpPort=8080
    ```
  - To list the WP versions available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress?tab=tags&page=1&ordering=-last_updated).
    ```bash
    python3 modifyCompose.py --listWpVer
    ```
  - To return the version to latest and port mapping to default and follow the prompts.
    ```bash
    python3 modifyCompose.py
    ```

- <strike> When changing the version of WordPress, the db name volume needs to be removed and then the folder, 'wpFolder' should be emptied using </strike>
- <strike> WordPress version can be changed by editing the docker-compose.yml file, and the tag for WordPress image </strike>

  **NOTE**

  For WordPress to create a correct bind-mount, ensure that the folder containing its compose file has a directory named 'wpFolder'

## TO-DO:
**_NOTE:_**  Tick off as done [ ] -> [x]

- [X] Create a <strike>Makefile</strike> CLI App to clean the wpFolder and remove the named volume whenever the user wishes (i.e. allowing easy change of WP versions)

- [X] Cross-Platform compatibility ~ Testing on Windows

- [ ] Testing Lab from Week 8 - Metasploit on Kali.

- [ ] Push image to Docker Hub and reduce build times on user end. Specifically the Kali image since it is static once built.
